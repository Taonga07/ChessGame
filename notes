line 57: need 0's to mach the length of the other list for when we combine them
line 62: it dose not matter if we choose column_path or row path their legth shoul be the same


we were going two have the list of pieces putting the king in check and then the path each piece had to the king which we were trying to create now. the column path was if we returned 0 we did not want endles 0 so we placed the amount of square up to that piece on the row to the list

# why elif on line 60
                        # at least one of column / row has to have a path (otherwise you're on top of the king already)
                        # but it could be both, or just one - so you need both to be if just in case

# then we test for the condition if either column/row are zeros
                        # you can have one or other, or neither, but not both

''' #can i have two else's like if else
                            are on the same column
                            #dosn't this need to be a list of 0's for each move - yes, they're on the same column ?? how would i do this then 
                            # hang on - I'm thinking it through okay 
                            ??list(range(square.row, test_piece.column): '0') ???
                            # we do its from the other list
                            # can i put them togerther in on_clicke thing 
                            # don't think so - trying to think through the logic ...
