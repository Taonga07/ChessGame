This is a two player game; playing against computer is not an option yet but could be.

A Guide is being written so you can make this project yourself but as the game is not yet finished neither is it.
Here is the link if you have acess to it https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOnf6xDqEIGD04JVzfhgvXFyDlK1BxJagbxBN3dT_7Q/edit

Currently the this branch holds the best code. so will be updated so all the errors and imperfections are dealt with in other branches.
The Rules are being developed at the moment. Curently I am working on [Check and Checkmate](https://github.com/Taonga07/Chess2030/tree/Check).
