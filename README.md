# Chess2030 - FileMenu

This Brach is currently the most up todate. Here I am working on the menubar and optimizing code. So far I have placed the Game into a class to save complication with passing stuff around. And fixed the menubar. In order to run the game run Main.py. NOTE: This dise not have check/checkmate in as will work with that later in other branch.

## Known Issues

- [x] customising the board makes the layout gow weird and game stops working
- [x] for move in possible moves move out of range error fixed
